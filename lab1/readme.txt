Lab1 - Game of Life:

This is game of life application. I implemented linear layout and relative layout.  I have used following widgets in the application - dialogue, grid view, button. Each cell in the application grid represents an image which on click changes to wood color image. Black image represents dead cell and wood colored cell represents alive cell.  

The game has two buttons.
Next button: takes the grid to the next level according to the current stage of the application
Reset button: on clicking the reset button the dialogue appears asking the user to confirm the action to reset the grid.
